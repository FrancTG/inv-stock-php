# Inv-stock
Inventory and business manager with PHP

## Setup

1. You need to __install a web server__ like Xampp and move the inv-stock-php folder into htdocs or the web directory you are using.

2. In the assets folder, load the ```setup-db.txt``` into your SQL database.

3. Change the ```src/settings.php``` file.

4. Open ```src/insert_new_user.php``` file, uncomment the code, change user data and password and open it in your browser. Then __re-comment the file or delete it__ to prevent user creation until it is available in the application.
